###DOM manipulation, callback lab.
Exercise

The quotes are all hardcoded in our web page. Let's start moving towards having a dynamic web application and set the existing quotes programatically via JavaScript.

Create an array of the existing quotes, each quote having text and author
Add the quotes to the page dynamically with JavaScript
Further: - Extend our quote application so that a user can add quotes. (Don't worry about these saving between refreshing page, we'll do this tomorrow)

Even Further: - Add functionality to delete quotes - Style page

Even Even Further: - While typing show the quote being created at real time.
